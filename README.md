# Redis-rb-cluster

Redis Cluster client work in progress.
It wraps Redis-rb, and eventually should be part of it.

For now the goal is to write a simple (but not too simple) client that works
as a reference implementation, and can be used in order to further develop
and test Redis Cluster, that is a work in progress itself.

Currently not usable at all but will evolve in the next days.
